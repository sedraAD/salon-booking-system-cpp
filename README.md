# Salon Booking System (C++)

A terminal-based salon booking system developed in C++ using object-oriented programming.

##  Project Overview
This project simulates a booking system for a hair salon where customers can book treatments with available hairdressers.  
All bookings and schedules are stored in text files, allowing the data to persist between program runs.

The project was developed as a final assignment in a C++ course and focuses on object-oriented design.

##  Features
- Create and manage customer bookings
- Handle multiple hairdressers and treatments
- Store bookings and available times in text files
- Menu-driven terminal interface
- Object-oriented structure using multiple classes

##  Technologies
- C++
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- File handling (`.txt`)
- Terminal-based application

##  How to Run
1. Compile all `.cpp` files together
2. Run the generated executable from the terminal

Example:
```bash
g++ *.cpp -o salon
./salon
```
